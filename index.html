        <h2>About</h2>            
        <p>
          We are a theory &amp; computations group at SUNY, Buffalo. The research in our group revolves
          around the following main themes:
        </p>
  
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000099;">Theory of quantum and quantum-classical dynamics.</span>
            We work to understand fundamental questions pertinent to quantum and quantum-classical dynamics (both adiabatic and non-adiabatic).
            We focuses on investigation and development of quantum-classical theories for modeling non-equilibrium charge and energy transfer.
            Some of the specific directions include: 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Non-local quantum effects in entangled trajectories description of quantum-classical dynamics
              </li>
              <li>
                Representation invariance of approximate quantum-classical methods
              </li>
              <li>
                Quantum coherence, entanglement, and correlation
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>	
          <br>
    
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000099;">Methodology development and implementation.</span>
            One of the group's goals is to deliver efficient and accurate implementations of the open-source sofwtware for chemical research. 
            The main speciality of the codes we develop is in nonadiabatic dynamics, which is pertinent to many processes such as charge transfer,
            electronic or vibrational energy relaxation, and photoinduced processes in molecular and solid-state systems. 
            A bit more specific areas of interest are:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Charge and energy transfer in large-scale systems
              </li>
              <li>
                New methods for accelerating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics
              </li>
              <li>
                New approaches to photoinduced reactive dynamics in excited states
              </li>
              <li>
                Software development for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000099;">Studies of excited state dynamics in energy materials</span>
            Naturally, we are interested applying the methods and tools we develop to study the real-time charge and energy 
            transfer processes in contemporary materials. These are the materials that are at the cutting edge of experimental
            research and have high potential to impact the society by enabling new technologies or notably improving the existing
            ones. With our approaches, we explore the details of the underlying processes that affect the properties of these systems.
            Some of the materials or systems that we are interested include:					
            <ul>
              <li>
                2D materials and their interfaces for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications
              </li>
              <li>
                Perovskites and chalcogenide perovskites
              </li>
              <li>
                Quantum dots and their assemblies
              </li>	
              <li>
                Light-emitting systems and materials for molecular electronics
              </li>
              <li>
                Exotic states of matter: Warm dense matter
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
