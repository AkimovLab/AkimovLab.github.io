          Daeho Han was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1995. He earned his BS in Chemistry from Ajou University in 2017 and obtained his Ph.D in Chemistry from Ulsan National Institute of Science &amp Technology (UNIST). With guidance of Prof. Seung Kyu Min at UNIST, Daeho delved into nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD) methods based on exact factorization (XF). He became one of developers of PyUNIxMD, a Python-based NA-MD software of the Min's group, and worked on developing new NA-MD methods tailored for extended and condensed systems, culminating in his thesis titled "Theoretical and Computational Description of Excited-state Phenomena in Condensed Phase." In October 2023, Daeho joined the Akimov group as a postdoctoral associate. First, he implemented and assessed trajectory-based NA-MD algorithms such as independent-trajectory XF methods (SHXF, MQCXF, EhXF), Quantum-Trajectory Surface Hopping (QTSH) and other internal algorithms, directly contributing to the Libra platform with his Python and C++ programming skills. Regarding the XF-based methods, he served as the main instructor at the Libra Workshop and Summer School in 2024. Furthermore, for simulating large-scale systems, he developed the Fully-Integrated Surface Hopping (FISH) method based on the neglect of backreaction approximation. Except for the trajectory-based algorithms, he also worked on the Local Diabatic Representation (LDR) dynamics method using the PyTorch features. Following his term at Buffalo, he has continued his career as a postdoctoral researcher at UNIST, appointed by the AI-CRED (AI Co-Research & Education for Innovative Drug) institute, S. Korea.

            Nijamudheen is from Kerala, one of the southern states in India. He obtained his BSc degree (2008) in Chemistry from the Calicut 
            University and MSc degree (2010) in Applied Chemistry from the Cochin University of Science And Technology (CUSAT). His thesis work for 
            the master’s degree was guided by <a target="_new" href="http://www.iacs.res.in/spectro/spad/index.html">Professor Ayan Datta</a> in the
            <a target="_new" href="http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Thirvananthapuram.</a> 
            Then, he remained in the same group and started his doctoral studies. In 2012, he moved with the Datta group to the 
            <a target="_new" href="http://www.iacs.res.in/">Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) in Kolkata</a> and received his
            PhD degree in 2015. His PhD thesis was on the “Computational Study of Structures and Electronic Properties of Metal Clusters”. 
            He is a postdoctoral research associate in the group of Professor Alexey Akimov since January 2016. Nijam's present projects involve
            modeling electron and hole relaxation and recombination in 2D materials and in perovskites.

            Brendan Smith was born in Buffalo, New York, and grew up in Rochester, New York. He graduated with a BA in chemistry 
            from the <a href="http://www.geneseo.edu/" target="_new">State University of New York at Geneseo</a>. During his time at
            Geneseo, Brendan had the privilege to work on two research projects under the guidance of 
            <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/chemistry/jeffrey_peterson" target="_new">Dr. Jeffery Peterson</a>. The projects were to
            investigate green aqueous solubilization schemes for CdSe core quantum dots, their ability to image Escherichia coli.,
            and the determination of the extinction coefficients of in house synthesized CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots. 
            As of Fall 2016, Brendan attends The State University of New York at Buffalo, SUNY and is pursuing his PhD under the guidance
            of Prof. Alexey Akimov. He currently in his 4th year of his Ph.D and has worked on several research projects to date. His research
            ranges from developing methods for treating quantum nuclear effects in molecular dynamics simulations, to developing non-adiabatic 
            molecular dynamics methods. For the latter, his focus is on non-adiabatic molecular dynamics within the neglect-of-back-reaction approximation.

            Anarzhan Abilgazy was born in Karaganda region, Kazakhstan, and grew up in Astana, Kazakhstan. She obtained her B.Sc. in Physics
            and a minor in Mathematics, and a minor in World languages, Literature and Culture from Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan (2017).
            During her undergraduate studies, she joined <a target="_blank" href="http://sergiybubin.org/group.html">the research group of Prof. Sergiy Bubin</a> 
            and worked on her B.Sc. thesis "Evaluation of mass-velocity relativistic correction in variational calculations with explicitly correlated Gaussian 
            basis functions with L=1 total orbital angular momentum". She is one of the founders of Poetry club at Nazarbayev University.
            In 2017, she started her PhD at SUNY-Buffalo, where she is a member of Prof. Alexey Akimov’s research group.

            “Center for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities at UB” (CURCA) for her research about “Povidone-Iodine and Nano-Calcium Sulfate:
            Potential as a Bone Scaffold with Antimicrobial Properties” under supervising Dr.Dziak (Feb 2013-Dec 2014). In January 2016 started her
            Master in chemistry and research under the guidance of Prof. Alexey Akimov group at SUNY-Buffalo. She is currently involved in modeling
            electron-phonon coupling in C<sub>60</sub> on Au vs CaF<sub>2</sub> surfaces, for understanding the pecularities of the sum-frequency generation

            school in multiple academic competitions. Achira took part in World Scholar’s Cup, 
            an international team-based essay writing, debating, and knowledge test competition where he won multiple honors awards. 
            He also competed in the International History Bee and Bowl (IHBB) Asia Division where he was invited 
            to compete in the 2017 IHBB Asian Championship in Singapore. Achira graduated secondary school as KPIS Class of 2018 Salutatorian. 
            In Fall 2018, he became an Aerospace Engineering student at the University at Buffalo. As of Spring 2019, Achira is performing 
            research assistantship with Brendan Smith in the Akimov Research Group. The research involves methodology development
            for incorporating the quantum effects of nuclei in molecular dynamics simulation in real time. The research utilizes Python 2.7
            and Libra, a Python library developed for computational chemistry.
