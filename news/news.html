          Nice remote collaboration with <b>Mr. Hamid Mehdipour</b> resulted in the paper describing modeling 
          charge tranfer dynamics in CdS/TiO2 interfaces. The work highlights the importance of electronic coherences
          in determining charge transfer rates.

          <b>Ekadashi's</b> work on Libra-Quantum Espresso (a part of Libra-X) is now accepted in J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 
          We have been able to describe photo-induced nuclear dynamics in various molecular systems 
          using fractional occupation numbers in delta-SCF method. This is a proof-of-the-principle and 
          description of the implementation. Now, looking forward to use this method in modeling condensed-matter systems.

          <b>Alexey's</b> work on phase correction in NA-MD is now accepted in J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 
          This is something that has to be accounted for, to make the timesceles predictions more
          reliable, consistent, and reproducible. Something we'll start using in atomistic simulations soon.

          <b>Alexey's</b> work on NA-MD with spin-orbit couplings
          is now accepted in ACS Energy Letters. This work won't be possible 
          without the great contributions of other collaborators, notably <b>Dr. Wei Li</b>. 
          Using this new approach, we showed that SOC leads to faster charge carrier relaxation dynamics.
