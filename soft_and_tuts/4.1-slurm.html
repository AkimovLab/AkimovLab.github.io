# 4.1. SLURM

 To run calculation on the CCR cluster, we use the job scheduler system called SLURM. 

 Basically, slurm scripts define how exacly you want the calculations to be run on the cluster.
 Note, this is NOT about WHAT calculations to run and how to setup the input for problem-specific 
 inputs.

 Of interest to SLURM scripts are the properties such as: for how long to run the calculations, 
 on how many nodes, in which sub-clusters to run them, and so on.
 
 Most SLURM scripts go like this:

    #!/bin/sh
    #SBATCH --cluster=faculty
    #SBATCH --partition=valhalla --qos=valhalla
    #SBATCH --job-name="test"
    ###SBATCH --output=slurm-test.out
    #SBATCH --time=00:10:00
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
    #SBATCH --mem=1500
    ###SBATCH --mail-user=???@buffalo.edu

    echo "SLURM_JOBID="$SLURM_JOBID
    echo "SLURM_JOB_NODELIST="$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST
    echo "SLURM_NNODES="$SLURM_NNODES
    echo "SLURMTMPDIR="$SLURMTMPDIR
    echo "working directory="$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR

    NPROCS=`srun --nodes=${SLURM_NNODES} bash -c 'hostname' |wc -l`
    echo NPROCS=$NPROCS


 **Explanation**:

 * ``#SBATCH --cluster=faculty`` : on which cluster to run the calculations, don't need to change

 * ``#SBATCH --partition=valhalla --qos=valhalla`` : on which partition (sub-cluster) to run the calculations
    This particular instruction requests to use our group's dedicated cluster/partition ("valhalla"). As a member
    of the group, you get a priority in running jobs on this cluster, unless other group members are fully using it.
    
    For other options in regard of which partitions to use and what are their limitations, refer
    to [here](http://www.buffalo.edu/ccr/support/research_facilities/general_compute/cluster-partitions.html)

    In particular, it is recommended to use ``--partition=skylake`` since those are relatively new (as of Dec. 2019)
    nodes and there are many of them. 

 * ``#SBATCH --job-name="test"`` : the name of the job you are running - for ease of finding it in the queue, but really 
    doesn't matter too much for any other purposes. You can keep it unchanged for all the jobs you submit.

 * ``###SBATCH --output=slurm-test.out``: the name of the file, where the ourput of the SLURM operations (and the stdout of)
    the programs and scripts executed by the slurm files will be printed out. This file is usually not that much useful, 
    maingly for some debug purposes (e.g. if the job crashes, it may contain the error messages that can be very useful for
    fixing the problems). 
 
    Note how there are 3 hash-tag characters instead of only one. This is to comment out the line of a SLURM script and make it
    inactive. In this case, the SLURM output file will be named after the job ID, so that if you submit several jobs from the same
    directory (try avoid doing that though), you can have distinct SLURM output files.

 * ``#SBATCH --time=00:10:00`` : how long do you think the job will take to comple? Format: hh:mm:ss

 * ``#SBATCH --nodes=1`` : on how many nodes to run the job

 * ``#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=12`` : how many cores per node to use for the job

 * ``#SBATCH --mem=1500`` : how much memory to reserve for the job, in Mb

 *  All the 4 parameters above: the job time, the number of nodes and cores as well as the amount of memory requested
    can affect the job priority - the more resources you request, the longer the job may be sitting in a queue
    before being actually executed. 

    If you request too much of resorces (exceeding limits or bare availability), the job will not be run and will be dropped.

    If your job exceeds any of the resources requested (usually the run time or memory) at any time of execution, it will be
    killed. 

    So it is highly recommended to use some good judgement and preliminary testing to find the right balance.

 * ``###SBATCH --mail-user=???@buffalo.edu`` : you can set up the emails related to this job to be sent to you email (e.g. 
   can't wait to see the results). But, of course, I prefer this option to be commented out (or you can remove it alltogether) so
   not to get too many of them (can be bothering after a while).

 The rest of the script contains a set of instruction of how to setup the actual calculations and how to run them. 

 In this particular example, the actual "calculations" look like ``echo NPROCS=$NPROCS`` which simply print out some current 
 environmental variables.


 Finally, to run the calculation (to "submit a job") do the following:

    sbatch submit.slurm

 Here, we assume the SLURM script shown above is saved in the file *submit.slurm* (it doesn't matter how the file is called and what is 
 it's extension name)


 To learn about the status of your (and others') jobs, do the following:

    squeue -M faculty -p valhalla

 To show the process for a given user (alexeyak, in my case), do this:

    squeue -M faculty -u alexeyak

 To show the results of the squeue command every second, do this: 

    watch -n 1 squeue -M faculty -p valhalla

 In this example, we are interested in what is going on in our *valhalla* partition
