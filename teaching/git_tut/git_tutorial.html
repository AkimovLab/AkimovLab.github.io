		  <h3>Note: in all following instructions, the character $ will represent the command line and it should not be typed.</h3>
		  
		  <p>In this tutorial, I will simulate the collaborative environment for code development. </p>
		  <p>First of all, create an account on the GitHub, if you haven't done so. I have created 2 GitHub accounts with usernames: 
		  alexvakimov (my main account), and alexvakimov2 - the account which represents an abstract collaborator.</p>
		  <p>In my main account, I have created a repository (which can be done very easily right in the browser). Well, I have initially created
		  only 2 files: LICENSE and README.md</p>
		  <p>First, I will show how to do things as a main developer (owner of the origin/master branch):</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Copy the repository to your local machine:
			<pre>git clone https://github.com/alexvakimov/test111111.git</pre>
			This creates a local directory "test111111" containing the copy of the project. Everyone can clone the project, because it is 
			shared publicly on the GitHub (free account).
		    </li>
			<li>Go to the test111111 directory: <pre>cd test111111</pre></li>
			<li>You can see that the directory contains only 2 files: 
			<pre>$ ls
LICENSE  README.md</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Create a new file "test1.py" in this directory using a text editor of your choice. The directory, will now contain 3 files:
			<pre>$ ls
LICENSE  README.md  test1.py</pre>
			</li>
			<li>"git status" - is the command that prints the status of the present repository. The created "test1.py" is new to the existing repository 
			(all the internal states are encoded in the hidden directory ".git"). That is why the "git status" command will print us the following message:
			<pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        test1.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

			</pre>		
			</li>
			<li>To add file to the repository use "git add":
			<pre>$ git add test1.py</pre>
			This will add the file "test1.py" to stage, that is git will start keep track of changes of this file. However, this file will not yet be 
			included in the branch - the present state of the file will not be memorised.
			</li>
			<li>To add the file into the revision history (memorize it) use "git commit":
			<pre>$ git commit -m "Add test1.py"
[master 89f762f] Add test1.py
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100755 test1.py</pre>
			Usually, do this when you are satisfied with the state of the file. If you think you have taken a wrong direction in the code development,
			you can return to the older state of the file (to the last commited state). We will discuss what to do with that later.
			</li>
			<li>Once the file addition is commited, you can check the status of your repository (actually that of your current branch)
			<pre>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Now, we want to update the remote repository (origin), to reflect our local updates: use "git push" command:
			<pre>$ git push origin master
