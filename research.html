      <!-- Quantum dynamics in energy and functional materials -->
      <div class="row">
        <h2>1. Quantum dynamics for energy and functional materials</h2>

        <p>
          Quantum dynamical processes are widespread in chemistry and physics. Among them, nonadiabatic processes (that is the processes that 
          involve more than one electronic or vibrational state) are especially important in solar energy harvesting materials, known as photovoltaics (PV)
          or photocatalytic materials, in photoactuated systems, molecular electronics, high-temperature superconductors, light-emitting diodes, and many other.
          The light-matter interaction creates the non-equilibrium states in the systems and cause the subsequent directional flow of energy and charge carriers - the
          working principles for many atrificial and natural light-harvesting and solar energy converting systems. Light-matter interaction can also cause 
          changes of molecular structure, which is utiulized by the nature as the molecular basis for vision. Such molecules can also be utilized in artificial 
          photoactuators and molecular machines. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In order rationally design novel materials and to understand the details of operation of artificial systems, it is imperative to gain comprehensive 
          insights into mechanims of energy conversion, charge transfer, and mechanisms of photoinduced molecular transformations. These processes are driven by
          complex interplay of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Computational modeling of these interactions and dynamics requires explicit consideraction of
          electron-phonon interactions, involving multile electronic states. For predictiveness, the electrons must be treated quantum-mechanically, wheras the complexity
          of the problems requires classical tretment of nuclei. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Akimov group utilizes quantum-classical nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD) approaches to describe the mentioned processes in a wide range of
          systems and materials. Our interests lie in understanding quanlitative trends in structure-property or condition-property relationships that are dictated
          by the electron-phonon interactions and nonadiabatic effects. 
        </p>

        <div class="col-9">
          <p>The materials/systems we have been working on recently include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Lead halide and chalcogenide perovskites.</b> Halide perovskites have recently attracted a lot of attentions from both experimentalists and 
                theorists, thanks to the remarkable solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiencies of some of such materials. With the help of NA-MD simulations, 
                we have identified a number of relationships that affect the timescales for electron and hole energy relaxation. The effect of both cation and anion
                doping on these parameters have been investigated. The role of atomic motions has been investigated. We have found some surprising results: for instance,
                the motion of electronically-inactive cations has a propounced effect on non-radiative relaxation of electrons and holes, since it modulates the electron-phonon
                interactions that drive such processes. 				
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, led halide and similar perovskites are prone to decomposition in the presence of water, which is unfaborable for their long-term applications
                in solar cells. Toxic led cations released during this decomposition is another potential problem. Recently, an alternative class of materials - chalcogenide 
                perovskites have been proposed and a potential subsituent of the conventional led-halide-based materials. Unlike the latter, chalcogenide perovskites on the 
                basis of barium-zirconium sulfide (BZS) must be doped with metals or anions to improve their electronic absorption properties. In parallel, doping may cause
                the unfortunate acceleration of electron-hole recombination, decreasing the efficiency of potential photovoltaic material. In our research, we have investigated
                systematic trends in such doping-induced acceleration of nonradiative processes. We have rationalized the computationally-derived trends on the basis 
                of fundamental concepts of molecular and electronic symmetries.

                <b>2D materials and heterojunctions.</b> Reduced dimensionality of the layered (2D) materials opens new perspectives for their use in photovoltaic, photocatalytic,
                electronic, and high-T superconductivity applications. The quantum confinement of the layered structures can notably affect their 
                optoelectronic properties, leading to high charge carrier mobilities, large recombination times, and favorable electronic absorption properties. 
                Among the 2D materials, the analogs of graphene, such as mono- or multilayered black phosphorus (phosphorene), silicene, germanene, and their numerous derivatives
                have attracted interest recently as promising, earth-abundant, stable, and non-toxic materials for photovoltaics and photocatalysis. In our research, we 
                characterize the potential of these systems to meet this goals. We establish the qualitative relationships between structure and details of the interfacial 
                geometry and composition and the lifetimes of the excited electrons and holes in these systems. We probe the role of defects and dopants, as well as the 
                specific and non-specific interactions in such heterojunctions.

              <p>
                <b>Photoinduced isomerization.</b> Using our ∆SCF-NA-MD approach, we have been able to study photoinduced nuclear dynamics in molecular and solid-state
                systems. We characterize the excited state energies and lifetimes, reorganization energies, photoisomerization quantum yields, and the mechanistic details
                of reactive processes in organic molecules. As an example, we have modelled photoinduced isomerization of ethylene, cis- and trans-azobenzene under various
                conditions. The results are generally in good agreement with existing experiments. We are looking to study the photoinduced dynamics in a variety of 
                biologically-relevant systems, such as DNA base pairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, we study the reactive phases of photoinduced isomerization of F2PN molecule in a gas phase. Recent experimental studies suggest
                possibility of complex isomerization dynamics in low-temperature argon matrices. Our simulations suggest that atomic rearrangements induced by the 
                light can lead to two distinct excited state relaxation timescales, associated with the transitions from alternative excited state geometries. 
                Our methodology that uses fractional occupation numbers allowed us to handle both the bond-breaking and formation at feasible computational costs.
                We are looking to extend this approach to investigate mechanisms of charge and energy transfer and reactive transformations in photocatalytic systems (e.g.
                a photooxidation at semiconductor or metal interfaces), as well as the dissociation-enabled vibrational energy transfer at metal interfaces.

                <b>Exotic-state systems: Warm dense matter (WDM).</b> Although the WDM is not conventional topic studied by chemists, it is ubiquitous in nature. One meets the 
                WDM in planetary cores, in high-temperature nuclear fission, in high-energy collisions. To understand these processes at the macroscopic level,
                physicists work hard to derive the so-called equation of state (EOS). Under the extreme conditions of high temperature and pressure, the energy of nuclei becomes
                comparable to that of electrons and a strong energy exchange between these sub-systems is expected. Such energy exchange can not be described without taking nonadiabatic
                processes into consideration. We have performed one of the first atomistic ab-initio-based NA-MD studies of electron-nuclear energy exchange in WDM aluminum. 
                Not only we have been able to capture the energy transfer timescales in agreement with those inferred from recent state-of-the-art experiments, but we have derived
                the general scaling relationships between these timescales and the macroscopic parameters.

        <h2>2. Methodology and Software Development</h2>

        <p>
          In the ideal world, theoretical and computational tools should be able to guide experimental efforts, be predictive and fast. However,			
          one quickly realizes that modeling of almost any sufficiently complex material or phenomena hits the wall of the computational methods being
          either too expensive or not accurate enough to be widely used. For this reason, the computation-enabled rational design of materials is still 
          a very challenging topic and a far-going endeavor for many scientists. 
        </p>

        <p>
         In the Akimov group, we strive to enable efficient, accurate, and easy-to-use simulations of the dynamical processes 
         that occur in various materials. The presently-available methods are often very expensive to apply or/and may not always have the 
         desired capabilities. Addressing the most urgent, application-driven challenges in computations, we work along several parallel directions.

            <b style="color:blue;">Software development for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD) simulations.</b> Modeling charge and energy transfer, dynamics of 
            electronic or vibrational energy relaxation, and photoinduced reactive processes require an explicit consideration of electron-phonon interactions and 
            nonadiabatic effects in the dynamics. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is the general methodology to account for such effect. 
            There is a large family of various NA-MD techniques, but the existing implementations are relatively scarce. Among the available packages, there is 
            another level of compications: some either too costly, others are limited in their applicability to certain types of systems and processes. Furthermore, many
            implementations take a "black-box" approach, difficult to extend, or may implement a limited number of developed algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Akimov group, we develop a variety of computational tools for NA-MD calculations and beyond, keeping the above points in mind.
            We ahere to the concept of modular, transferable, open-source, and easy-to-use/easy-to-extend sofwtare. The developed software serve as a platform for 
            improving the efficiency and accuracy of the methodologies and as the practical tools to drive the applied materials research.

                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Quantum-Dynamics-Hub/Libra-X">Libra-X</a> is a practical tool for modeling electron and electron-nuclear
                dynamics in molecular and solid-state materials. It is built on the basis of the Libra components, which take care of the dynamics and processing 
                whereas the third-party packages, such as <a target="_blank"; href="http://www.quantum-espresso.org/">Quantum Espresso</a> or 
                <a target="_blank"; href="http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/">Gamess</a> can be utilized to perform accurate and efficient electronic structure calculations.
                Libra-X can make use of the mixed classical and quantum description of the studied systems, it can utilize customizable scripts to perform non-standard calculations,
                it boasts a variety of surface hopping procedures and approaches to handle electron-nuclear interactions. For instance, unlike our other package, PYXAID, it 
                is suitable to describe photoinduced isomerization or even photoinitiated decomposition of molecules.

                The acronym stands for the PYthon eXtension for Ab Initio Dynamics. The code implements the famous FSSH algorithm for NA-MD.
                The package boasts efficient algorithms for integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, which enables modeling nonadiabatic
                dynamics in the Hilbert spaces with over 1,000 quantum states. The use of excitonic basis allows studying correlated electron-hole
                and multi-electron dynamics. The package allows explicit consideration of the field-matter interactions and various decoherence
                correction schemes. It can be used with ab initio, DFT or semiempirical methods that provide electronic structure information.
                The PYXAID/PYXAID2 packages are flexible and versatile thanks to the user interface realized via the Python scripting.

                <b>NA-MD in large-scale systems.</b> Quantum dynamics simulations in atomistic systems composed of several hundreds of atoms is very
                computationally demanding. On one hand, this is the consequence of the costs associated with electronic structure calculations, which
                scales at least cubically with the number of basis orbitals. On the other hand, the dynamics itself implies increased computational costs due to
                the trajectory length and the need for representative sampling of initial conditions. Depending on the details of dynamical methodology, one meets additional
                complications stemming from the method construction. For instance, in the trajectory surface hopping-based methods, one needs many trajectories to properly
                represent the possibly histories of the wavefunction evolution. In all, quantum-classical dynamics simulations may become prohibitively expensive
                even for small systems, for which static electronic calculations may be relatively fast. We address the complexity issues above by developing a
                <b>fragmentation-based NA-MD methods</b> and interfasing the NA-MD procedure with novel linear-scaling electronic structure methodologies that
                can handle large systems. One of the challanges in this endeavor is to ensure the invariance of the results with respect to the chosen fragmentation scheme.

                <b>Accelerated NA-MD.</b> Unlike static electronic structure calculations, where advanced but computationally-expensive methods can still be used,
                the NA-MD simulations require thousands of such calculations to be repeated, to produce the trajectories. The length of trajectories is determined by the
                intrinsic rates of processes under investigation: in order to model slow processes, long simulations must be executed. 
                In addition, in the trajectory-based calculations, a good sampling of the rare events must be obtained, which may contriute to even further increased
                computational complexity of the simulations. In order to model slow nonadiabatic processes, we develop the accelerated NA-MD techniques. One strategy is based on
                the biasing electronic transitions via the magnitude of nonadiabatic coupling and recovering the original timescale via analytical scaling relationships.
                An alternative approach has been in constructing a quasi-stochastic Hamiltonian and using it to run long simulations directly at the negligible computational costs.

                <b>Photoinduced reactive dynamics</b> We develop the ∆SCF-NA-MD approach to describe reactive nuclear dynamics in excited electronic states.
                The electron-phonon back-reaction is explicitly accounted for in this approach, allowing us to model photoisomerization and photostimulated bond-breaking reactions.
                This capability is critical for direct modeling of photocatalytic processes in real time. In the ∆SCF-NA-MD method, we inexpecively describe electronic 
                excited states by constraining molecular orbital populations. The fractional occupation numbers allow us to mimic multiconfigurational effects, which are especially
                important when bonds are broken or made. Our approach is especially promising for periodic environments. This approach is implemented in our

        <h2>3. Theory of Quantum and Quantum-Classical Dynamics</h2>

        <div class="col-7">

          <p>
            Capturing quantum effects with the formally classical formulations of the dynamics based on multiple trajectories has fascinated many researchers. 
            Such an approach helps one to understand the intricacies of quantum mechanics in the intuitive and familiar language of classical mechanics. The
            trajectory-based approaches also promise larger flexibility in reducing computational costs (once suitable approximations are made). In addition, 
            quantum-classical trajectry techniques may help one to resolve detils of reactive processes, providing detailes description of potential outpomes of 
            simulations. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            Among the quantum non-local effects that can be captured with the help of trajectories are: zero-point energies, wavefunction branching and decoherence,
            tunneling and superexchange. In order to capture such effects, we develop the <b>entangled Hamiltonian dynamics (ETHD)</b> method. The method originates from
            rigorous quantum equations, known as Heisenberg equations of motion. These equations can be mapped onto a classical Hamiltonian, which we use as the starting point
            of our dynamical procedure. The distinctive point of such effective Hamiltonian is that it mixes up the trajectries in the ensemble, allowing them to 
            communicate with each other, and hence mimic certain non-local effects. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In the past, we have demonstareted that allowing the classical trajectories to exchange energies, one may solve the so-called "superexchange" problem 
            in quantum nonadiabatic dynamics. This concept was demonstatrated in the second-quantized surface hopping (SQUASH) method. However, in SQUASH the exchange of
            the trajectory energies occurs only at the surface hops, involves only kinetic energy exchange, and implies some ad hoc energy redistribution schemes.
            In the present ETHD theory, the energy exchange across the interacting (entangled) trajectories is taken care of by the rigorously-derived term in the effective
            Hamiltonian.

                <p>
                  <b>Theories of trajectory-based decoherence.</b> We design and test new approaches to incorporate decoherence effects in nonadiabatic simulations.
                  One of the strategies being explored relies on a non-unitary instantaneous projection of the wavefunctions of a phonon-perturbed
                  Hamiltonian onto the basis of the eigenfunctions of the non-perturbed Hamiltonian. Because of the lack of completeness of the two bases, 
                  the resulting dynamics becomes non-unitary and has the potential to drive the overall wavefunction to a certain preferred state. 
                </p>
              <p>
                Another approach is based on the assumption that the instantaneous nuclear wavefunction can be approximated by the Boltzmann factors. The resulting 
                mean-field type equations contain and additional friction term that causes the wavefunction collapse to one of the preferred states. In the meantime, it is 
                also expected that the term can deliver a proper thermalization of the electronic states.

                <b>Representation-dependence of quantum-classical methods.</b> The results of approximate quantum-classical simulations may depend on the
                choice of representation in which the dynamical calculations are conducted (e.g. basis). This is an unfortunate for the predictive
                or even the interpretive power of the simulation methods. We carefully investigate the underlying transformations to ensure the representation
                invariance of the methodologies. We find the conditions under which the invariance can be achieved and we develop the invariants that may be used to interpret
                the experimental data.
